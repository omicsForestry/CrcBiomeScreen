Description: A developed and benchmarked reproducible machine learning framework
  for microbiome-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. By systematically 
  evaluating normalization strategies, taxonomic resolutions, and class imbalance
  handling. This R package allows users to apply the full pipeline or selectively 
  run specific components depending on their analytical needs. It establishes a 
  scalable foundation for developing interpretable microbiome-based screening 
  tools to support early CRC detection. This approach could be easily implemented 
  in a national screening programme, to improve early detection rates for 
  this disease.
